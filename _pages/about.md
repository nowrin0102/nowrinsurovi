I am deeply interested in exploring advanced artificial intelligence in the domain of additive manufacturing, with a particular focus on automating design, monitoring, and defect detection processes to enhance efficiency and productivity.

Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a position I have held since January 2024. I completed my Ph.D. from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in September 2023. 

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I served as a Research Assistant at the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR).
