  I am deeply interested in applying <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to advance <strong>manufacturing</strong>, with a particular focus on <strong>additive manufacturing</strong>. My research aims to automate and optimize key stages of the manufacturing workflow — including <strong>design</strong>, <strong>process planning</strong>, <strong>monitoring</strong>, <strong>defect detection</strong>, and <strong>post-processing</strong> — to enhance precision, efficiency, and productivity in next-generation manufacturing systems.

<p>
  I am currently a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> at the <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong>, where I have been working since <strong>January 2024</strong>. I earned my <strong>Ph.D. in Engineering</strong> from the <strong>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)</strong> in <strong>September 2023</strong>, specializing in intelligent manufacturing technologies.

  Prior to my Ph.D., I served as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at the <strong>Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR)</strong>, contributing to applied research in industrial innovation and process development.

I am deeply interested in exploring advanced artificial intelligence in the domain of additive manufacturing, with a particular focus on automating design, monitoring, and defect detection processes to enhance efficiency and productivity.

Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a position I have held since January 2024. I completed my Ph.D. from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in September 2023. 

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I served as a Research Assistant at the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR).
