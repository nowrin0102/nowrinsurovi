using image processing method.
importance: 7

1. Collected different diseased skin images such as eczema, scabies, pyoderma, ringworm, psoriasis, MRSA etc.
2. Extracted different features from the digital skin images such as mean, contrast, uniformity, reverse smoothness, entropy etc. and based
on the features differentiate the category of skin diseases.
3. Developed an algorithm for analyzing and diagnosing skin diseases to a good degree of accuracy that may help dermatologists in making
decisions.
